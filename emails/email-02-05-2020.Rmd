Hello ladies,

Thank you for becoming part of Data Girls! ‚ù§
Data Girls is aimed at providing Data Science related skills. Once all of you feel confident enough, we will hopefully move towards a project based approach.

After carefully examining your responses it was decided that Data Girls will operate in the following manner:

    - Most of the activity will be conducted over discord. Join by clicking on this link.
    - Since the days you were available weren't that compatible, most of the workshops will either be recorded or shared with you via a jupyter notebook.
    - You are highly encouraged to share your experiences and to work on preparing workshops for our community. Most of us come from a Computer Science background, so if you possess skills in financial analysis, or business analytics we would be happy to learn more through you.
    - Gradually the club will integrate most of the content in a webpage.
    - There might be occasional club meetings to require feedback and find ways in which we could improve the club.
    - There are no workshops uploaded on the discord group chat at the moment as the first workshop is still work-in-progress.You will be notified via email everytime a workshop is ready. 

Considering the fact that this is only the beginning, the above specifications might change. Data Girl's end goal is to create a community of learners and people who share knowledge regarding Data Science. 
At the moment Data Girls is an effort we work on in our free time, so it is highly recommended to be understanding when a group member is not able to help you right away.
Not everything might be perfect at the beginning, but I believe we will figure it out together what is the best way to improve our knowledge.

I am really excited to embark on this journey with you all!

Feel free to respond to this email with your questions or comments and don't forget to join the discord group chat to say hi and introduce yourself.

Best regards,
Danjela
