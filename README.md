## ACT Data Girls 

This repository contains blueprints of how The Data Girls club at the American College of Thessaloniki will operate. 
ACT Data Girls is an effort I have decided to undertake to promote diversity in my college's tech community. The content of the material used in club meetings and workshops will  be related to Data Science with an emphasis on functional programming and open source software. 

ACT Data Girls is thought to organize at least one workshop a month and once every club member is on the same track the club will turn to a project based approach. 
Both Business and Computer Science ladies are encouraged to participate as Data Science is an all-encompassing field. 

### Code of Conduct 

- No denigrating behavior will be accepted in the club. 
- Every club member has equal rights to propose changes on how the club should operate. 
- Be considerate, inclusive, and respectful. 
- Make differences into strengths. 
- Remember that you rise by lifting others. :heart:
